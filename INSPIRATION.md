# The Story Behind WindowSeat

My girlfriend lives in Chicago, I'm in NYC. We fly back and forth all the time.

After a few trips, I realized we kept talking about what views we'd catch from our flights - sometimes the NYC skyline at night was right infront of us and sometimes nothing because we picked the wrong side of the plane.

How do you even know which side of the plane to sit on? There's no way to figure it out unless you've flown that exact route before and even then, there's nothing really to give you odds on where to sit.

So I built this. Now we both know which seat to pick.
